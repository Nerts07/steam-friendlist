# React + Vite

This is my first React project, i made dynamic steam friends list using props, components and JS logic to make it properly.
Almost everyone's first project is "Todo list", so.. i am not that 'everyone' :D

URL to see it: https://elegant-strudel-0e8d00.netlify.app/

or clone this repo, and do 'npm install' to install all depends and run 'npm run dev' 
be sure that node.js is already installed on your pc

if node.js lacks on your pc:
1 - download chocolatey from https://chocolatey.org/install (if you are on windows 10/11)
2 - then type in powershell: choco install nodejs --version="23.3.0"
3 - open cmd and be sure that node.js is installed: node -v # should print `23`
